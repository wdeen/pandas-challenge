Module 4 Challenge (Pandas &amp; Jupyter Notebook) - Wassim Deen

# Summary of Challenge
- Create a Jupyter script solution & use the 'Pandas' library to do the following:
    1. Merge datasets from separate csv files into one 'Complete' DataFrame (complete_school_df)
    2. Using complete_school_df, calculate 'Local Government Area' summary values and store in a new DataFrame (area_summary)
    3. Using complete_school_df, calculate summary values per school and store them all in a new DataFrame (per_school_summary)
    4. Using per_school_summary, create a new DataFrame and sort by % Overall Passing values in descending order (top_schools)
    5. Using per_school_summary, create a new DataFrame and sort by % Overall Passing values in ascending order (bottom_schools)
    6. Using complete_school_df, create a new DataFrame that lists the Average Maths Score values for students in each year level per school (maths_scores_by_year)
    7. Using complete_school_df, create a new DataFrame that lists the Average Reading Score values for students in each year level per school (reading_scores_by_year)
    8. Using per_school_summary, create a new DataFrame that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (spending_summary)
    9. Using per_school_summary, create a new DataFrame that breaks down school performance based on school size (size_summary)
    10. Using per_school_summary, create a new DataFrame that breaks down school performance based on school type (type_summary)
